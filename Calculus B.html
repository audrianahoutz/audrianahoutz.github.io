	<h2>Course Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Calculus B</strong> is the second part of a two-course sequence designed for non-STEM majors at the University of Notre Dame. This course builds on foundational calculus concepts, focusing on applications and methods that are essential for understanding the mathematical world around us.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Topics Include:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integration and Applications:</strong> Techniques and applications of integration, including finding areas, volumes, and solving problems in physics like density, work, and energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Integration Methods:</strong> U-substitution, integration by parts, trigonometric substitution, partial fractions, improper integrals, and numerical integration techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Two-Variable Calculus:</strong> Partial derivatives, double integrals, and applications in both Cartesian and polar coordinates.</li>
                <li><strong>Introduction to Differential Equations and Numerical Methods:</strong> Basic differential equations, along with numerical solutions, and Lagrange multipliers.</li>
                <li><strong>Sequences and Series:</strong> Convergence tests (including ratio test), geometric and infinite series, power series, and Taylor polynomials.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The course emphasizes real-world applications of mathematics, helping students develop strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and the ability to synthesize solutions across different contexts.</p>

	<p> The notes seen below are from when I was a teaching assistant (i.e. ran the tutorial) in Spring 2022. They are organized weekly topic. I will be replacing them with daily notes as the semester goes on.</p>
